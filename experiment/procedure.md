Step 1 : To aware the connection diagram of the given system 
         3-Phase suplly --> input terminal of autotransformer
         Two output terminal of autotransformer  --> two terminal of voltmeter 
         any two output terminal of autotransformer--> two terminal of motor 
         one output terminal of autotransformer --> one terminal of ammeter
         one terminal of motor --> another terminal of ammeter


Step 2 : Shift the MCB switch to start the power and note the phase. Initially itâ€™s in RBY phase and  can changed further. 
Step 3 : Put on the switch of Autotransformer to start the motor.
Step 4 : Note the direction of rotor, which depends on the phase that we set using phase switch.
Step 5 : Click on the TACHOMETER to obtain the speed of the motor and note it down
Step 6 : Put off the switch of Autotransformer when you wish to stop the rotor.
Step 7 : We can change the phase only by switching off the MCB.
Step 8 : Repeat the steps from 2 to 6 and each time note the direction of rotor and RPM from Tachometer.
